The IPL Winning Prediction System utilizes logistic regression algorithm implemented with NumPy and Pandas to predict the outcome of IPL matches. It reads match-related data from a dataset using Pandas, preprocesses the data, selects relevant features, and trains a logistic regression model. This model is then used to predict the probability of winning for each team based on input parameters such as batting team, bowling team, city, target runs, current score, overs, and wickets. The system provides users with accurate predictions, aiding cricket enthusiasts in making informed decisions and analyzing match outcomes effectively.
